## What's this?

This is a [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) app that I am building for
a local dog rescue group in Houston.

The backend is modeled around
(http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-restful/)[RESTful]
services.

Also, the backend uses amazon's
[s3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) via
[marcel](https://github.com/marcel)'s beautiful api
[api](https://github.com/marcel/aws-s3). For the templating system I
use [haml](http://haml-lang.com/).

The frontend is driven by
[backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/).

I wanted to drop the code for future reference. Let me know if you
want to contribute or if you find it useful for your own projects.

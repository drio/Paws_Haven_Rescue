## What's this?

This is a [http://www.sinatrarb.com/](sinatra) app that I am building for
a local dog rescue group in Houston.

The backend is modeled around
[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-restful/](RESTful)
services.

Also, the backend uses amazon's
[http://aws.amazon.com/s3/](s3) via
[https://github.com/marcel](marcel)'s beautiful api
[https://github.com/marcel/aws-s3](api). For the templating system I
use [http://haml-lang.com/](haml).

The frontend is driven by
[http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/](backbone.js).

I wanted to drop the code for future reference. Let me know if you
want to contribute or if you find it useful for your own projects.

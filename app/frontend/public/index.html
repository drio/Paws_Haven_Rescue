        The A-Team revolves around the four members of a former commando
        outfit, now mercenaries. Their leader is Lieutenant-Colonel/Colonel John
        "Hannibal" Smith (George Peppard), whose plans tend to be unorthodox but
        effective. Lieutenant Templeton "Face" Peck (Dirk Benedict; Tim Dunigan
        appeared as Templeton Peck in the pilot), usually called "Face," is a
        smooth-talking con-man who serves as the team's appropriator of vehicles and
        other useful items. The team's pilot is Captain H.M. "Howling Mad" Murdock
        (Dwight Schultz), who has been declared insane and lives in a Veterans
        Administration mental institution for the show's first four seasons. Finally,
        there is the team's strong man and mechanic, Sergeant First Class Bosco Albert
        "B.A.," or "Bad Attitude," Baracus (Mr. T).

        For its first season and the first half of the second season, the team was
        assisted by reporter Amy Amanda Allen (Melinda Culea). In the second half of
        the second season, Allen was replaced by fellow reporter Tawnia Baker (Marla
        Heasley). The character of Tia (Tia Carrere), a Vietnam war orphan now living
        in the United States, was meant to join the Team in the fifth season,[11] but
        she was replaced by Frankie Santana (Eddie Velez), who served as the team's
        special effects expert. Velez was added to the opening credits of the fifth
        season after its second episode.
